This is a Super Mario Bros. game and editor I built many years ago.  Nostalgia
goggles are encouraging me to clean things up and put this on GitHub. It tries to
recreate the original Super Mario Bros. using Super Mario World's graphics.

**The libraries used for this project are archaic**, but maybe the code will inspire
someone to build something cool.

See the `README.md` in each submodule for more information:

* [mario-slick](mario-slick/README.md) - The game itself, written in Slick, which 
  uses LWJGL for rendering
* [level-editor](level-editor/README.md) - The level editor used to make the game's
  levels
