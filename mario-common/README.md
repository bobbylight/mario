# mario-common - Common data required by all subprojects
This submodule contains data and classes reusable by all sister
subprojects. Think of it as a base class containing all shaerd
resources.

Currently, this project contains all game data:

* Game definition
* Level definitions
* Image files used for tilesets, enemies, Mario, etc.

All other subprojects should import this one.
