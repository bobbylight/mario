# mario-slick - A Super Mario Bros. Game
Written with lwjgl/slick many years ago.  Perhaps this could be used as the
basis for a libgdx implementation.

## To-Do/Bugs
1. Grabbing a star does nothing
2. Being "on top of" an object checks bottom center point, not left- and right-
   corners. (Still true??)
3. Option to skip "GamesAtLunch Presents" and title screens.
4. Can jump (and throw a fireball) immediately after coming out of a "down" pipe.
